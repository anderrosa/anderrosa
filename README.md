ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @anderrosa

I'm a beginner developer, always looking to learn more and explore new technologies. I began my journey into the world of programming with Shell and C, while immersed in the practical and tested experience of the 42 Rio pool, and I am currently deepening my knowledge of Python through Rocketseat courses.

Here, you will find some of my projects, learnings and maybe even some creative solutions to problems I faced during my studies. I'm passionate about problem solving and I'm always willing to try new tools and languages.

ðŸ”§ Technologies I'm learning:

Python (Beginner)

Shell (Beginner)

C (Beginner)

ðŸ’¡ My goal is to continue improving my skills and contributing to interesting projects. Feel free to explore and interact!
